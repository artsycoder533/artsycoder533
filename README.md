## Overview

I am a Software Engineer at [Township](https://www.township.agency/) and Founder of [Ten-23 Agency](https://www.ten23.agency/), my freelancing agency.  I enjoy all things front-end, but also wouldnt mind dipping my toes into the backend as well! I created a [YouTube channel]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGjYAACGwNLzYcTpXnvZ_Q](https://www.youtube.com/@artsycoder533)) to document my web development journey, to give others insight into how I landed my first role.
